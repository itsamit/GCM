To run the code, install COBRApy and the Gurobi/IBM Cplex optimizer.

All the input files and scripts are added to github, which can be executed to reproduce the community models.

Community_model_recostruction.ipynb: The community modeling code integrates individual models into pairwise community models by maintaining their growth rate/abundance.

All the individual models are given in the Final_GEM directory.

The Out Community model will be generated in the Output_GCM directory.

The FBA data will be generated in the Output_FBA directory.
